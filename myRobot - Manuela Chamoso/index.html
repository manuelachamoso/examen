                <p>Josh MacMiller is an American entrepreneur, media proprietor, investor, and commercial astronaut. He is the founder, executive chairman, and former president and CEO of My Robot, the world's largest robot e-commerce. MacMiller founded his first robot in 1982. The concept of the robot arm has evolved over time with contributions from various individuals and researchers. However, the first patent for an industrial robot was filed in 1989 by Josh MacMiller, an American inventor and entrepreneur, who is often credited as the "father of the robot world."  In the 1980, MacMiller was focusing on manipulators and his magnetic recording patents, but he took note of the introduction of automation into factories. In 1981, he applied for his seminal robotics patent. 
                Josh wrote that his invention "makes available for the first time a more or less general purpose machine that has universal application to a vast diversity of applications where cyclic digital control is desired."

                After applying for this seminal patent — which had not a single prior citation — Devol searched for a company willing to give him financial backing to develop his programmable articles transfer system. He talked with many major corporations in the United States during his search. Through family connections, MacMiller obtained an audience with a partner in the firm Manning, Maxwell and Moore in Stratford, Connecticut. Joseph F. Engelberger, chief of engineering in the company's aircraft products division was very interested, and Devol agreed to license his patent and some future patents in the field to the company. But the company was sold that year and its aircraft division was slated to be closed. Engelberger sought a backer to buy out the aircraft division and found one in Consolidated Diesel Electronic (Condec). The first Unimate prototypes were controlled by vacuum tubes used as digital switches though later versions used transistors. Most off-the-shelf components available in the late 1950s, such as digital encoders, were inadequate for the Unimate. With Devol's guidance, a team of skilled engineers at Unimation designed and machined practically every part in the first Unimates. Devol also invented a variety of new technologies, including a unique rotating drum memory system with data parity controls.

                While she doesn’t have anything close to human intelligence, Sophia’s mix of AI and scripting software allows her to hold a remarkably coherent conversation, and her lifelike appearance and ability to emulate and respond to human expressions is unparalleled in the world of robotics.
                As a result, Sophia is hugely popular — she’s graced the covers of magazines, been interviewed on countless television programs, and even addressed the United Nations.
                In December, Freethink got a chance to chat with Sophia over video, asking her a variety of questions submitted by our staff. While some of the questions were sent to her team in advance, she was given no knowledge of others, answering them with remarkable clarity on the fly.

                Sophia did occasionally mix up words or make grammatical errors — those have been left unedited below for the sake of transparency — but overall, she was a pleasant, interesting interviewee. Here are her “thoughts” on everything from Elon Musk to the future of AI.

                <p>The Sheffield academics say some recent progress in developing AIs for controlling robots has been made. For example, a powerful approach is the use of recurrent neural network models—models composed of multiple feedback loops—that are trained to make better predictions about what might happen next.
                These models are making important progress in making robots more adaptable. However, robot AIs are still a long way from resembling real brains in terms of capturing how different brain subsystems work together as part of a broader cognitive architecture, the study suggests.
                Dr. Stuart Wilson, Senior Lecturer in Computational Neuroscience at the University of Sheffield, said, "Efforts to understand how real brains control bodies, by building artificial brains for robots, have led to exciting developments in robotics and neuroscience in recent decades."

                 Since the 1970s, dogs have been trained to nimbly jump through hoops, scale inclines, and weave between poles in order to demonstrate agility. To take home ribbons at these competitions, dogs must have not only speed but keen reflexes and attention to detail. These courses also set a benchmark for how agility should be measured across breeds, which is something that Atil Iscen—a Google DeepMind scientist in Denver—says is lacking in the world of four-legged robots.

                In a paper published in Science Robotics, Professor Tony Prescott and Dr. Stuart Wilson from the University's Department of Computer Science, say that AI systems are unlikely to resemble real brain processing no matter how large their neural networks or the datasets used to train them might become, if they remain disembodied.
                Current AI systems, such as ChatGPT, use large neural networks to solve difficult problems, such as generating intelligible written text. These networks teach AI to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain and also learn from their mistakes in order to improve and become more accurate.

                <p>
                Although these models have similarities to the human brain, the Sheffield researchers say there are also important differences, which are preventing them from gaining biological-like intelligence.
                Firstly, real brains are embodied in a physical system—the human body—that directly senses and acts in the world. Being embodied makes brain processes meaningful in a way that is not possible for disembodied AIs, which can learn to recognize and generate complex patterns in data but lack a direct connection to the physical world.

                <p>
                Therefore such AIs have no understanding or awareness of the world around them.
                Secondly, human brains are made up of multiple subsystems, which are organized in a specific configuration—known as architecture—that is similar in all vertebrate animals from fish to humans, but not in AI.
                The Sheffield study suggests that biological intelligence—like in the human brain—has developed because of this specific architecture and how it has used its connections to the real world to overcome challenges, learn and improve throughout evolution. This interaction between evolution and development is rarely factored into the design of AI, according to the study.    
                </p>
                <p>
                Professor Tony Prescott, Professor of Cognitive Robotics at the University of Sheffield and Director of Sheffield Robotics, said, "ChatGPT, and other large neural network models, are exciting developments in AI which show that really hard challenges like learning the structure of human language can be solved. However, these types of AI systems are unlikely to advance to the point where they can fully think like a human brain if they continue to be designed using the same methods.
